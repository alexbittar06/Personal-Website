      <p class="text-xl text-zinc-300">
        Hi, I'm Alex, a senior at the University of Notre Dame double-majoring in Computer Science and Political Science. I'm interested in how technology, policy, and human behavior intersect, and how thoughtful software can be used to solve real-world problems.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Background & Experience</h2>
      <p class="text-zinc-300">
        My academic and project experience spans algorithm design, SAT solvers, and applied software development, with hands-on experience building full projects from idea to implementation. Recently, I've been working on a fitness tracking and activity analysis project that combines my interests in health, data, and user-centered design.
      </p>
      <p class="text-zinc-300">
        Beyond software development, I've written research papers on politics in Latin America, exploring the intersection of policy, governance, and social dynamics in the region. I enjoy writing and find that it complements my technical work, helping me communicate complex ideas clearly and think critically about the broader implications of technology and policy.
      </p>
      <p class="text-zinc-300">
        I've also worked extensively with data analysis, using various tools and techniques to extract insights, identify patterns, and inform decision-making. This experience has strengthened my ability to approach problems systematically and think about data-driven solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-zinc-300">
        I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to grow both technically and creatively. Whether it's building web applications, exploring new frameworks, solving complex algorithmic problems, or analyzing data, I'm always eager to dive in and learn.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Outside of Coding</h2>
      <p class="text-zinc-300">
        Outside of class, you'll usually find me at the gym, playing or following video games, or exploring theme parks in Orlando while thinking about systems design and user experience. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and finding inspiration from various sources.
